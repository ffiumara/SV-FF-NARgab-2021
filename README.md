Scripts:

- 1-r-to-z-converter: converts a matrix of r coefficients into a matrix of z scores;
- 2-polyQ-z-extractor: extracts from a z score matrix values related to pairwise combinations of polyQ proteins belonging to a set of interest and to a control set of randomly selected polyQ proteins;
- 3-polyQ-interactome-extractor: extracts from a BioGrid-derived interactome those interactions involving polyQ proteins;
- 4-cluster-extractor: extracts sets of polyQ protein IDs related to functional clusters;
- 5-random-control-generator: generates control sets of randomly selected polyQ protein IDs equinumerous with those in functional clusters (script-4);
- 6-subnetwork extractor: extracts from the overall polyQ protein interactome (script-3) subnetworks formed by sets of cluster-related or randomly selected polyQ proteins;
- 7-interactome-extractor: extracts from a BioGrid-derived interactome sets of polyQ proteins interacting with a set of n randomly selected polyQ proteins and generates matched equinumerous control groups of randomly selected polyQ proteins;
- 8-z-extractor: extracts from the z score matrix (script-1) all the z scores related to pairwise combinations of the protein sets generated by script-7.
